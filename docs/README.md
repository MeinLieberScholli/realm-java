# Realm SDK for Java
Use the Realm SDK for Java to develop Android apps in Java or Kotlin.
To develop multiplatform apps using Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP), refer to the
Kotlin SDK.

## SDK in Maintenance Mode
This SDK is in best-effort maintenance mode and **no longer receives
new development or non-critical bug fixes**. To develop your app with new
features, use the Kotlin SDK. You can use the Java SDK with the Kotlin SDK.

## Develop Apps with the SDK
Use the SDK's open-source database - Realm - as an object store on the device.

### Install the Java SDK
Use the Gradle build system to
install the Java SDK in your project.

### Define an Object Schema
Use Java or Kotlin to idiomatically define an object schema.

### Open a Database
The SDK's database - Realm - stores objects in files on your device.
Or you can open an in-memory database which does not create a file.
To get started reading and writing data,
configure and open a database.

### Read and Write Data
Create, read, update, and
delete objects from the database.
Use Android-native queries to filter data.

### React to Changes
Live objects mean that your data is always up-to-date.
You can register a notification handler to watch for changes and perform some
logic, such as updating your UI.
